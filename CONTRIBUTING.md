# Contributing Guideline

We ove your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and 
transparent as possible, whether it's:
* Reporting a bug
* Discussing current state of the project
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing a new feature
* etc

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.  
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all 
code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to 
propose changes to the codebase.
